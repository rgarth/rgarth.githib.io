I have been running a Wordpress blog on Redhat Openshift for several years.
Recently Redhat's free-tier was removed. I hadn't updated the blog in a few
years, so I decided to start fresh.

Setting up a Jekyll site on Github is super easy. If I feel the need to blog,
I will do it here.

Setting up this blog was literally 5 minutes work. There is not much more
needed than forking Barry Clark's Jekyll-now repo: <https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now>.
